		<div class="about">
			<p class="aboutcompany">The Datax Shipping Corporation was
				established on October 2nd, 1961, by the amalgamation of Eastern
				Shipping Corporation and Western Shipping Corporation. Starting out
				as a marginal Liner shipping Company with just 19 vessels, the DSC
				has today evolved into the largest Indian shipping Company. The DSC
				also has substantial interests in various segments of the shipping
				trade. DSC's owned fleet includes Bulk carriers, Crude oil tankers,
				Product tankers, Container vessels, Passenger-cum-Cargo vessels,
				Phosphoric Acid / Chemical carriers, LPG / Ammonia carriers and
				Off-shore Supply Vessels. Sailing through for nearly five decades,
				the DSC today has a significant presence on the global maritime map.</p>
			<p>Free on board the exporter delivers the goods at the
				specified location (and on board the vessel). Costs paid by the
				exporter include load, lash, secure and stow the cargo, including
				securing cargo not to move in the ships hold, protecting the cargo
				from contact with the double bottom to prevent slipping, and
				protection against damage from condensation. For example, "FOB JNPT"
				means that the exporter delivers the goods to the Jawahar lal Nehru
				Port, India, and pays for the cargo to be loaded and secured on the
				ship. This term also declares that where the responsibility of
				shipper ends and that of buyer starts.</p>
			<p>The exporter is bound to
				deliver the goods at his cost and expense. In this case, the freight
				and other expenses for outbound traffic are borne by the importer.
				Carriage and freight (now known in the US as "cost and
				freight")(C&F, CFR, CNF): Insurance is payable by the importer, and
				the exporter pays all expenses incurred in transporting the cargo
				from its place of origin to the port/airport and ocean freight/air
				freight to the port/airport of destination. For example, C&F Los
				Angeles (the exporter pays the ocean shipping/air freight costs to
				Los Angeles). most of the governments ask their exporters to trade
				on these terms to promote their exports worldwide such as India and
				China. Many of the shipping carriers (such as UPS, DHL, FedEx) offer
				guarantees on their delivery times. These are known as GSR
				guarantees or "guaranteed service refunds"; if the parcels are not
				delivered on time, the customer is entitled to a refund. Carriage,
				insurance and freight (now known in the US as "cost, insurance and
				freight")(CIF): Insurance and freight are all paid by the exporter
				to the specified location. For example, at CIF Los Angeles, the
				exporter pays the ocean shipping/air freight costs to Los Angeles
				including the insurance of cargo. This also states that
				responsibility of the shipper ends at the Los Angeles port. The term
				"best way" generally implies that the shipper will choose the
				carrier who offers the lowest rate (to the shipper) for the
				shipment. In some cases, however, other factors, such as better
				insurance or faster transit time will cause the shipper to choose an
				option other than the lowest bidder.</p>
